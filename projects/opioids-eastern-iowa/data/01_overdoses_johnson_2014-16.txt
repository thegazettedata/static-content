Since I do the majority of the statistics for JCME, Mike asked that I follow up with you regarding your request for information on overdoses in Johnson County. Below is a list of the number of deaths for each year requested:
2014: 8 heroin; 9 opioid
2015: 3 heroin; 3 opioid
2016 YTD: 1 heroin; 1 opioid
 
Please note that the 2016 statistics are only those in which the autopsy report has been completed. It can take more than 60 days for an autopsy report to be completed, including toxicology. It is therefore important to understand that these numbers for 2016 are behind by at least 2 months and therefore are only really a representation of about 1.5 months in 2016.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.
